# learning-on-hard-examples (WIP)

Optimize learning algorithms with use of only examples with a large cost.

Inspired by "Accelerating Deep Learning by Focusing on the Biggest Losers" paper

## Backboan model

Described in Lambda Lab's [blog](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/resnet9-train-to-94-cifar10-accuracy-in-100-seconds).
